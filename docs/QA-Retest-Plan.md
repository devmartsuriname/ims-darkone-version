# üß™ QA Retest Plan - Phase 2

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive QA retest plan following Phase 1 Critical Fixes. All modules must be validated before UAT deployment.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1 Fixes to Validate

### Critical Fix #1: Notification Service
**Issue**: `allowedOrigins` undefined causing edge function failures  
**Fix**: Added `allowedOrigins` array to notification-service  
**Test Cases**:
1. Open browser console and verify no "Failed to fetch" errors
2. Navigate to `/admin/notifications` and verify notifications load
3. Test notification creation from any workflow action
4. Verify CORS headers in network tab (should show proper origin)

**Expected Result**: All notification API calls return 200 status, no CORS errors

---

### Critical Fix #2: Missing Route Registrations
**Issue**: 12 routes existed but were not registered in router  
**Fix**: Added all missing routes to `src/routes/index.tsx`  
**Affected Routes**:
- `/control/schedule` - Schedule Control Visit
- `/control/visit` - Control Visit
- `/control/visits` - Control Visits List
- `/reviews/technical` - Technical Review
- `/reviews/social` - Social Review  
- `/reviews/social/assessment` - Social Assessment
- `/reviews/archive` - Review Archive
- `/qa/dashboard` - QA Dashboard
- `/polish/security` - Security Polish
- `/polish/uat` - UAT Polish
- `/deployment/guide` - Deployment Guide
- `/security/final-validation` - Security Final Validation
- `/documentation/technical` - Technical Documentation
- `/documentation/user-guide` - User Guide
- `/monitoring/system-health` - System Health Monitoring

**Test Cases**:
1. Navigate to each route directly via URL
2. Verify page loads without 404 error
3. Verify role-based access control works
4. Check for console errors on page load

**Expected Result**: All routes accessible and render correctly
